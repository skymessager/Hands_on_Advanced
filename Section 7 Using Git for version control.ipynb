    "## What is version control\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control or revision control or source control management (SCM) in the most general sense is a system of managing changes to documents, files or any kind of information on a computer. In the context of software engineering and programming *Version Control Systems (VCS)* manage revisions of source code. While SCM can be part of other software (e.g. track changes in Word), for revision control of source code VCS are typically standalone programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most common ones are:\n",
    "* CVS (once very common but now largely obsolete)\n",
    "* Subversion (spiritual successor of CVS)\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "Downloads for the windows installers of the official releases can be found at https://git-scm.com/. Note that there is also the [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) project which is essentially a fork of the official git version with a focus of providing a native windows toolset. \n",

    "## Using git\n",
    "\n",
    "The central element where git stores all information is the repository. A local git repository is simply a working directory with an additional `.git` folder. In this folder git stores a snapshot of the work contained in the working directory everytime you commit a change. Note that git stores the changes only, so the snapshots are very space-efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a repository\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a repository you use the `git init` command, which creates an empty repository. Alternatively you can \"clone\", i.e. create a working copy of another repository using `git clone [location]` where `location` can be a local path or remote url for example to clone the shortcourse notebooks you would use `git clone https://gitlab.com/python4photonics/ofcshortcourse.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic git workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The local repository contains three \"trees\" that git manages to keep track of your changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"gittrees.png\">\n",
    "from https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working directory\n",
    "\n",
    "The _working directory_ holds your actual files that you edit using your favourite editor. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Index/Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "The _index_ or _stage_ is an area where you add or _stage_ changes before committing them to the repository. This is useful to group changes in several files that belong together in a single commit. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Head\n",
    "\n",
    "The _Head_ is the state of the repository at the last commit. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we are working on a file we would thus follow a workflow like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git add somefile.txt\n",
    "$ git commit\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git add file.txt anotherfile.txt\n",
    "$ git commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is illustrated in the figure below (taken from https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/02-basics/). The `git add` command adds the changes or new files to the _index_ (or stage), with `git commit` we then create the snapshot of the current stage. \n",

    "### Send your changes to a remote repository\n",
    "\n",
    "While your changes are now commited to the _HEAD_ of your local repository it is generally a good idea to keep a remote copy of you changes for example on [github](https://github.com). If you cloned your repository from a remote you can send your changes using the _push_ command `git push origin master`. If you have not cloned from an existing repository but want to connect your repository to a remote server you need to first connect the two with `git remote add origin <server url>` before you push your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branching\n",
    "\n",
    "The real power of version control is the ability to work with branches. This allows to develop different features simultaneously without changing the working state of the main part of the repository, i.e. **isolate different tracks of work**. Because git is so powerful, there are many different workflows around branching and a whole course could be taught around this, here we will cover the basics which is sufficient for many however. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic concept behind branching is illustrated below:\n",
    "<img src=\"octopus.jpeg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Branching enables us to:\n",
    "* keep one working branch (by convention this branch is often called the \"master\" branch)\n",
    "* work on a new feature, often several, that might remain unfinished\n",
    "* separate the work on different lines well\n",
    "\n",
    "The points where lines separate is called **branching**, the points where they reconnect is **merging**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### To create a new branch\n",
    "\n",
    "New branches can be created with `git branch [branchname]`. However, with that command we are still on the starting branch to switch to the new branch us `git checkout [branchname]`. There is a shortcut to create and switch to a new branch with `git checkout -b [branchname]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merging branches\n",
    "\n",
    "To merge a branch back into the current branch use `git merge [branchname]`. Assuming you are on current branch _master_ this would merge the changes from _branchname_ into _master_. If there have been changes that conflict with each other, i.e. changes to the same lines in the same file on both branches, then conflicts need to be resolved manually. However, we will not cover that here. \n",
