    "We have now tested out how to use pyvisa to control the EXFO OSA, laser and powermeter. However, a big script like in the previous section is not really sustainable if you want to reuse your instrument control. So let us look at how to make a reusable library for these instruments and how to use them together. \n",

    "## What is Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "from wikipedia:\n",
    "> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of \"this\" or \"self\"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words OOP is about creating object with certain characteristics and methods that can be used to access and control the behaviour of these objects. This also explains why it lends itself to instrument-control, the instruments are actually \"real\" objects that we are controlling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is very well suited for OOP, because while it can be used for programming in many different ways, it was designed with OOP in mind and many concepts in Python are based on OOP."
   ]

   "source": [
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "* basic understanding of object-oriented programming\n",
    "* how to build lab instruments using object-oriented programming\n",
    "* how to put several instruments together \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things we don't cover\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the following concepts make OOP very powerful. We will not cover them today, but we highly recommend you read up on them!\n",
    "* inheritance\n",
    "* metaprogramming\n",
    "* duck-typing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important** While we will be using jupyter notebooks for writing the object here, generally you do not want to have your instrument control libraries in a notebook. Notebooks are great for initial experimentation, analysis and debugging, but you can not easily include (or import) the code from your notebook into other programs. Instead of copy and pasting your instruments from notebook to notebook, put them into a separate Python file that you can then import like any other Python module. "
